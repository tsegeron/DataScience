# DataScience
*Some projects for DS*

The projects focus on basic programming skills with Python and the most popular and useful data science libraries.
There are tasks for collecting data with parsing, preprocessing data using *Pandas* and *SQL* and building pipelines with machine learning algorithms.

Each day has its own readme.md describing the tasks of that day and `en.subject.pdf` with full tasks:
- [day00 – UNIX Command Line Tools](day00/00_UNIX_Command_Line_Tools.md)
- [day01 – Overview Of Python Syntax](day01/01_Overview_Of_Python_Syntax.md)
- [day02 – Object-Oriented Programming](day02/02_OOP.md)
- [day03 – Package Management And Virtual Environment](day03/03_Package_Management_And_Virtual_Environment.md)
- [day04 – Efficient Code Practices](day04/04_Efficient_Code_Practices.md)
- [day05 – Pandas](day05/05_Pandas.md)
- [day06 – SQL](day06/06_SQL.md)
- [day07 – Data Visualization](day07/07_Data_Visualization.md)
